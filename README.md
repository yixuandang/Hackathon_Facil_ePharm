# Hackathon_Facil_ePharm

A Front_End Webpages Solution for a French Startup  
It is a Hackathon I took part in when I was in 42 University.  
The major purpose of this project is to save time for pharmacist and patients. Although I did not win any prize, still I learned a lot about `html` `css` and `javascript`.

## Cautions

I just linked all the pages by fake login and logout, gonna do the real website link later.  
Please check out the design of the homepage(index.html) It is really bright and fresh
