# Hackathon_Facil_ePharm

A Front_End Webpages Solution for a French Startup  
It is a Hackathon I took part in when I was in 42 University.   
The major purpose of this project is to save time for pharmacist and patients. Although I did not win any prize, still I learned a lot about `html` `css` and `javascript`.

Please check out the design of the homepage(index.html) It is really bright and fresh
